# CNN Binary Classifier
Following project constitutes a part of learning process towards
completion of the author’s Master Thesis. The main aim was to create
a binary classifier that is able to distinguish between triangles and
circles with usage of Caffe framework. The repository holds all scripts
used during development process with appropriate set of descriptions.
Unfortunately, the train network could not be uploaded due to GitHub’s
100mb file size restriction.
